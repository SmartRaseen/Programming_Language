Why TypeScript?
JavaScript is a dynamic programming language with no type system. 
JavaScript provides primitive types like string, number, object, etc., but it doesn't check assigned values. 
JavaScript variables are declared using the var keyword, and it can point to any value. 
JavaScript doesn't support classes and other object-oriented features (ECMA2015 supports it). 
So, without the type system, it is not easy to use JavaScript to build complex applications with large teams working on the same code.


How to use TypeScript?
TypeScript code is written in a file with .ts extension and then compiled into JavaScript using the TypeScript compiler. 
A TypeScript file can be written in any code editor. A TypeScript compiler needs to be installed on your platform. 
Once installed, the command tsc <filename>.ts compiles the TypeScript code into a plain JavaScript file. 
JavaScript files can then be included in the HTML and run on any browser.
